General tapandagr license
Version 1, Milopotamos, Drama, Greece

1. General data
"tapanda.gr" is the url of our software house. From now on, if we refer to
"the company", "our team", "we", "our house" it means the exact same thing, tapanda.gr.
On the same context if we refer to our "email" this is info@tapanda.gr
                       
2. Guarantee
The software is being distributed "as is". Even though we try to fix any
issue as soon as possible, we do not guarantee about its functionality
nor we are responsible of loss of any kind (such as data, money,
reputation or anything else).

3. Distribution for free
You are welcome to distribute it. If you do it though, you have to refer to
our own repository. We do not have any issue of you working on top of it, as
long as you distribute our own part the same way we do.

4. Paid distribution
You are not allowed to distribute our own software for a fee even if you modify it or not.
In case you want to monetize your code, we do require our own part.
Contact us at info@tapanda.gr for negotiations

5. Premium versions (addons.prestashop.com, codecanyon.net, tapanda.gr etc)
Most of the times we distribute software on github to show our skills and
publish premium version on respective marketplaces for a fee. The free version
is packaged with additional code in the last option. Sometimes we use a legal license
from other software houses for some operations.

For our own part of the code, you have to send us an email and describe
precisely key factors such as:
  - What problem your own application will solve
  - Existing market share (if any)
  - Target audience
  - Expected financial data (sales, profit, turnover etc)

After that, we will investigate your case and will contact you in a few days.

For the part of the code we do not own (the code we use from other houses),
it is up to their disposal. You have to contact them directly and follow
their own instuctions.

6. Support
Support in free versions is up to our own disposal. We do love supporting
the whole of our clientele, but the premium clients will have priority.
